1. According to these languages (using Java as the example), 'if' statements are
to be followed by one of several different kinds of 'statements'. In this case,
the statement begins 'y = 2' but is invalid becuase it is what the grammar
specification (in the case of Java SE 13 langauge spec.) describes as a
'StatementExpression' which must be terminated by a ';'. Hence, 'y = 2' does not
compile but 'y = 2;' would do so.

2. Let e = epsilon.

    a. The CFG for strings of 0's and 1's with an equal number of 0's and 1's
    is:

        S -> 0S1S | 1S0S | e

    b. The CFG for strings of 0's and 1's with an unequal number of 0's and 1's
    is:

        S -> U | V
        T -> 0T1T | 1T0T | e
        U -> T0U | T0T | U0T
        V -> T1V | T1T | V1T

3. Let e = epsilon.

    a. The CFG for {a^(i)b^(j) | i, j >= 0} is:

        S -> TU
        T -> aT | e
        U -> Ub | e
    
    b. The CFG for {a^(i)b^(j)a^(k) | i + j = k, k >= 0} is:

        S -> TU
        T -> aTV | aTU | e
        U -> bUV | e
        V -> a
